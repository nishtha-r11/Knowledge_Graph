      "\n",
      "First, let's understand what each PID represents based on its description:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **P22 (father)**: This refers to the male parent of a subject. It could be used for influential individuals when their father is also notable, but it's not directly about their own influence or media presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **P25 (mother)**: Similar to P22, this indicates the female parent. Again, relevant if the mother is influential, but not necessarily about the subject's own media presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **P26 (spouse)**: This shows who someone is married to or their partner. If an influential person is married to another notable figure, this could be relevant. However, it depends on whether the spouse's influence ties into the subject's public image.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **P27 (country of citizenship)**: This describes which country recognizes the subject as a citizen. It's quite relevant because knowing someone's nationality can be crucial in media contexts, especially for politicians or celebrities associated with their country.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **P30 (continent)**: This specifies the continent the subject is part of. While it provides geographical context, it might not directly relate to media influence unless tied to specific regions or issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **P31 (instance of)**: Indicates the class the subject belongs to. For example, a person instance. This seems foundational but doesn't directly speak to media relevance unless combined with other properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **P35 (head of state)**: Refers to an official with the highest authority in a country. This is definitely relevant as heads of state are prominent figures in media and public discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **P36 (capital)**: The seat of government for a country or region. While important geographically, it doesn't directly relate to individuals' influence unless discussing governmental structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **P37 (official language)**: Specifies the official language(s) of a place. Useful for context but not directly about influential people.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **P38 (currency)**: The currency used by an entity. Again, useful for economic context but doesn't tie directly to individual influence or media presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, evaluating relevance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Relevant PIDs**: Those that directly relate to the subject's influence, role, or recognition in public spaces. So, P27 (nationality) is relevant because it ties into media narratives about individuals. P35 (head of state) is clearly influential and appears frequently in media.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Irrelevant PIDs**: Those that don't specifically connect to the individual's media presence but provide more factual or structural information. For example, P22 (father), while important for family context, isn't directly about media influence unless the father is also a public figure.\n",
      "\n",

So I'll mark this as 'no'.\n",

      "P66: 'ancestral home' refers to where someone's ancestors came from. This could be relevant if the person is a public figure and their heritage is notable, but it might not always be directly related to their influence in media. It's a bit on the fence, but I think it's more about personal history rather than media presence. So probably 'no'.\n",
      "\n",
      "P69: 'educated at' indicates where someone went to school. This is definitely relevant because educational background can be important for public figures and often mentioned in media. For example, knowing that a celebrity attended a particular university could be newsworthy. So this should be a 'yes'.\n",

      "P84: 'architect' refers to the designer of a building. Architects can be influential, especially if they've designed iconic structures. Media often covers famous architects and their work, so this should be a 'yes'.\n",

      "5. **P94 (coat of arms image)**: This is about heraldry, relevant to entities with coats of arms but not directly to influential people's media presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **P97 (noble title)**: Noble titles are certainly associated with influential people, especially those who might appear in historical or royal contexts in media. So this seems relevant.\n",
      "\n",

      "8. **P101 (field of work)**: This describes someone's specialization. Knowing their field can indicate influence if it's in media or related areas. So this should be relevant.\n",

      "9. **P102 (member of political party)**: Being part of a political party is definitely influential and often discussed in news and media. Definitely relevant.\n",
      "\n",
