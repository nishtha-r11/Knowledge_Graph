      "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of Wikidata properties and wants me to determine which are relevant for influential people, persons, places, or entities that appear frequently in media, social media, TV programs, movies, sports programs, news programs, or other public spaces.\n",

      "Starting with P6: \"head of government.\" This seems highly relevant because heads of government are prominent figures in media and politics, so tracking them makes sense. So, I'll mark this as yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is P10: \"video.\" Since videos are a common way to feature individuals or places in media, this property could be useful. However, the description mentions it's more about relevant videos, which might not always tie directly to influential entities, but it can still be relevant. I'll tentatively mark yes here.\n",
      "\n",
      "P14 is \"traffic sign.\" This seems less likely to relate to influential people or places in media contexts. So, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "P15: \"route map\" refers to images of route maps. While this could be used for location-based entities, it's more about geographical information rather than influential individuals. I'll mark no here.\n",

      "Looking at P16: \"transport network,\" which describes the infrastructure part of a network. This doesn't directly relate to people or media presence, so no.\n",
      "\n",
      "P17 is \"country.\" Countries are certainly relevant as places in media and public spaces, so yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "P18: \"image\" refers to images of subjects. Since influential individuals and entities often have images associated with them in media, this property is definitely relevant. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "P19: \"place of birth\" connects a person or character to their origin. Birthplaces can be significant in biographies and news, so yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "P20: \"place of death\" similarly ties an individual's end location. This information is often highlighted in media, especially for notable people. So yes.\n",
      "\n",
